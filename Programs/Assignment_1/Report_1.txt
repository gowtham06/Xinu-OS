Q1) What is Orphan and Zombie processes?
Orphan Process:
An Orphan process is a process whose parent process finishes its execution and this process (child process) is yet to finish its execution.
This process is soon adopted by init process after its parent process dies.

Zombie Process
A Zombie process is a process which has finished its execution but it has an entry in the process table which needs to be reported to the parent process.
The parent process then reads the exit status of its child process and removes its entry from the process table.


Q2)   What are the changes that occur when the child process calls the exec system call to execute a new program?

The exec system call replaces current running process and loads new program. 
The stack segment, data segment and heap segment are replaced by new programsâ€™ segments respectively. 
Also, it does not return the control to the calling process.
